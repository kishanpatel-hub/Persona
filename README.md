## Analysis method and algorithm

### Sentiment analysis with tidy data

When human readers tries to understand a text, we use our understanding of the emotional meaning of words to determine whether text is positive or negative, or perhaps they show more meaningful emotion like sadness or trust. 

Text mining Technique can be used  to understand the emotional meaning of text. One approach to identify and analyze the sentiment of a text which is to consider the text as a combination of unique words and the sentiment of the whole text as the addition of the sentiments of the individual words. There are also some other ways to do sentiment analysis, but this is the most used , and an technique which uses advantage of the tidytext tool ecosystem.

### The sentiments dataset

As described , there are a many of methods and library that exist for understanding the emotion/opinion  in text. The sentiments dataset of tidytext package has sentiment lexicons.

The three lexicons are

➢	BING from Bing Liu and collaborators,

➢	AFINN from Finn Arup Nielsen and 

➢	NRC from Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney

All the lexicons are based on single words. These lexicons contain 17000 English words and those words are assigned by points for negative/positive sentiment, and emotions like trust, surprise, disgust, etc. The NRC divides words in a binary manner (“true”/“false”) into sections of joy, anger, positive, anticipation, surprise,negative,fear,disgust,trust, and sadness. Words are divided in a binary format by bing lexicon. The AFINN lexicon assigns words with a points ranging between -5 and +5, with negative points indicating negative sentiment and positive points indicating positive sentiment. The get_sentiments() function of tidytext used to get sentiment of specific lexicons

OCEAN (Openness, Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness) personality indicator was calculated using the personality traits generated during sentiment analysis based on research. OCEAN personality indicator is global benchmark for personality indication in BIG five factors. each factor is defined in high and low category where high saws how much person is likely to fall in that factor and low category saws how much person is unlikely to fall in that particular factor.
